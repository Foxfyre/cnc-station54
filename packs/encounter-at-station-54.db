is a spirit who is constantly and permanently driven by its hunger. It most often appears as an old man with a cane but outside of that, mimics the attire of those it sees. Its skin, hair, clothing, hair, and eyes all appear to be made of white, cracked stone and feel as such, despite its mobility. It constantly walks with a cane in one hand. The cane is actually a part of the spirit and cannot be dropped.</p>\n<p>Niniyan will grin at its intended victims but will never speak. It either doesn't hear or doesn't understand languages. Or perhaps doesn't care.</p>\n<p>The spirit is hunger personified and no amount of feeding can satiate it. Some see this being as tragic, as it is consumed beyond its ability to control by its constant need. While it can be smart and even devious at times, it is always in service of its primary goal. No one is entirely sure if Niniyan is a singular being or there are multiples. No one has ever seen or heard of there being more than one at a time.</p>\n<p>While Niniyan can attack all humans, it has a vulnerability to the blood of women and will seek to avoid them. It cannot feed on their blood (see Healing below) and Niniyan will simply attempt to kill them if forced to defend itself from such a person.</p>\n<p>For Niniyan, the act of violently rending flesh is the way it feeds, whether with its hand, its cane, or its mouth. It does not actually need to orally consume flesh to survive.</p>\n<p>While its physical form can be destroyed, most believe that this simply transfers the spirit back to The Black or another spirit plane and that Niniyan could return at some point. However, once in the FifthWorld - this plane- many believe the spirit is stranded here and cannot willingly leave this world on its own.</p>\n<p>Typically, Niniyan focuses on a single small group of people, a farm or village for example, and uses its abilities to terrorize and drive away the women, while emboldening everyone else to draw them out so that it can feed on them. It's theoretically possible to reason or bargain with Niniyan if it's offered something that can help sate its hunger.</p>\n<p>As Niniyan is damaged, pieces of stone will begin to chip and fall off of him.

Your Character may keep the connection going as long as they choose. The Character cannot receive any personal sensory information from their own body or move while using this Ability.

Instead of shearing an object, the blade severs the molecular bonds entirely and cleanly. It should be noted that these blades are not only extremely dangerous (even potentially to the user), but are likely to draw a lot of attention as they are housed in special electromagnetic sheaths, which keep the blade from accidentally doing damage and are very obvious. While it's not illegal to own Anicha blades, people will assume that a person carrying one has hostile intentions or should be considered dangerous.

Rather than objectively making the Character harder to see, this Ability affects the minds of those around them so that the user of the Ability is less likely to be noticed, except perhaps out of the viewers peripheral vision.</p>\n<p>To Activate Chameleon&rsquo;s Shine, Characters spend a Secondary Action, spend 1 point of Soul, and roll a Dice Pool equal to twice their Spirit.

This applies to all forms of organic vision, even those with technological assistance like goggles or cybernetics, as the Ability directly affects the brain. However, electronic sensors that operate without an organic component, such as an alarm with a heat sensor trigger or a motion detector, will be unaffected by Chameleon&rsquo;s Shine.</p>\n<p>Characters may make a Perception Check as a Secondary Action each Round to keep track of a Shined Character if they have been seen. If they don't Succeed, they do not know the Character&rsquo;s position and cannot attack.</p>\n<p>Successes gained through the activation of this Ability are also added to your Character&rsquo;s Physical Defense while they are Shined. If the Shined Character actively interferes with or attacks another Character in any way, they pop back into full visibility and the Character must re-Activate the Ability on a subsequent Round in order to use it again. The new Successes replace the previous result.</p>\n<p>If Shined outside of an Encounter, the Character must spend 1 additional point of Soul per hour past the first to stay hidden.

are fairly ubiquitous devices that assume the same role as a smartphone and a laptop does in our world. They are often worn on the forearm (but not always and there are many variations, brands and styles). The word Niisi is a generic slang term that encompasses a wide range of portable, personal computing and communication devices. A basic Niisi can access nearby daso, take photos and videos, record audio, has a voice recognition interface, can share information with other niisi and can do many of the same basic functions that our modern mobile devices can do. The devices are found on the vast majority of city living people and are common even among more rural folks. Some newer models actually project their information in a tiny three dimensional holographic format that floats just above the screen and can be manipulated by the user's finger

are fairly ubiquitous devices that assume the same role as a smartphone and a laptop does in our world. They are often worn on the forearm (but not always and there are many variations, brands and styles). The word Niisi is a generic slang term that encompasses a wide range of portable, personal computing and communication devices. A basic Niisi can access nearby daso, take photos and videos, record audio, has a voice recognition interface, can share information with other niisi and can do many of the same basic functions that our modern mobile devices can do. The devices are found on the vast majority of city living people and are common even among more rural folks. Some newer models actually project their information in a tiny three dimensional holographic format that floats just above the screen and can be manipulated by the user's finger

Suddenly, you're nearly blinded by a bright light, a spotlight mounted to a modified drone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have each of the Players choose their Initiative Score.

A young woman’s voice speaks. “Good Morning Kolisoo, apologies for interrupting your training. The Council of Twelve has sent a summons. Report to the Council Hall immediately.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When they remove their Second Eye Headsets, they are in a large dirt circle marked by stones. Their gear sits off to one side and the path to Cahokia leads West. Any Damage received during the simulation is immediately healed.</p>\n<p>Cahokia is a bustling, open city that sprawls for miles. Brightly painted low buildings constructed on earthen mounds contrast against 100-foot-tall spires. Yutsu barges float effortlessly just above the rooftops while smaller sunwings zip around the sky. People go about their shopping and children play with their grandparents under an almost cloudless sky.</p>\n<p>While the world opens up and gets more hospitable, treaties are fraying, and the unexplored north inspires excitement in some and fear in others. The Characters remind people that the world is changing, and they may react with discomfort.</p>\n<p>The Council’s receiving chamber is accessed at the top of a series of short broad steps. The walls are painted in patterns that draw your eye to the broad, curved table where the Council sits. These are the representatives of the most powerful tribes and families in Cahokia and are accustomed to deference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arenia, a grey-haired Councilor with taut dark skin and piercing eyes, addresses you.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for coming promptly. I understand that this is your first mission; congratulations on joining the ranks of the Suyata. Your service is appreciated. There may be a problem at one of our northern Stations and we are sending your team to investigate. Not a glamorous first assignment, but prove yourselves and more opportunities will come.</p>\n<p>Station 54, an atmospheric research station, has stopped sending communications. The nearest community, Sakitawaak, reports that the scientists stationed there have not been seen in three weeks. The mission details have been sent to your niisi, submit your reports when the mission is complete. Prosperous Journey.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Characters are ushered out as another group, likely a political delegation, enters. Their niisi display a priority message including their mission briefing. They are to travel to Station 54 and determine why communication has stopped, investigating if it seems a crime has been committed. They’ve been authorized to use force as necessary. They are advised to proceed cautiously if investigating in Sakitawak, as it is an independent community and not subject to the Council. Also included is a map of the area and a brief datasheet on the three scientists stationed there.</p>\n<p>If the Characters research the village or station, they can use their niisi with a Computer Check, or research at the library and make Knowledge or Science check as appropriate. If the Players consider Hacking the government systems, it’s a good time to remind them that they work for the government, and understand going in that information was “need to know.”</p>\n<p>They have about two hours before the next yutsu barge heading north leaves, giving them the opportunity to interact with their families or do some shopping before they go. They will have to take the barge to the north terminal, then travel by foot to Antiwaa. From there, they will continue to Sakitawaak a village a few miles from Station 54.</p>\n<table style=\"height:78px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:10px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:10px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:10px\">Computer Search: Sakitawaak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Population 70, Chief Export: Lead.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:34px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:34px\">Town is outside daso range.

Detail their travel only so long as it’s interesting then immediately cut to them approaching Antiwaa.</p>\n<p>As the sun begins to go down, you see the town ahead, a couple dozen structures surrounded by farms carved out of hard soil. As a Suyata, your first responsibility is to present yourself to the local leaders. Suyata teams are few and are expected to offer their services, so long as it does not conflict with the Council’s orders.</p>\n<p>If the Characters seek out the town’s leaders, they find the home of Siik who invites them to join his family for dinner. After a pleasant meal and conversation, he shoos his family away so he can speak with the Characters privately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I didn’t want to worry my children. I’m glad that you’re here and I hope you can look into something for us. Recently I’ve been receiving reports of a small group traveling north. Ordinarily this wouldn’t be a concern, but they move like a military unit, but they aren’t from the Free Lands.” He takes a datapad from a shelf and pulls up a blurry image of four people moving single file up a hill. “They evaded a group of volunteers who went out to look for them and seemed to be heading north. I don’t want to be the man who ignores the signs of a possible invasion. I was going to send a request for a Suyata team tomorrow morning, but then you arrived.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters question Siik further, he only knows that they were first sighted a day before and that they have been covering their tracks well — it was only luck that their passage was discovered at all.</p>\n<p>If the Characters investigate the image or the tracks and signs discovered by the town, they can make a Knowledge or Tracking Check respectively to try to identify the figures.</p>\n<p>There are many ways that your Players might want to tackle this problem, and all of them can’t be anticipated.

When the Characters decide to continue that way, they can get additional supplies from Siik before they go. The travel is uneventful. Further north the air gets colder and the land more barren, the signal on their niisi fade and is completely gone by the time they reach the village, meaning they can only communicate as far as the horizon now. As they approach Sakitawaak, read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The village ahead is laid out in a series of concentric rings, set in an open, flat area with an imposing cliff wall to the north, running east to west. The solar and wind generators seem to be kept in good repair, and robot harvesters are working fields to the east. You don’t see any yutsu barges or sunwings, but that’s not unusual for communities this far from large scale printing facilities.</p>\n<p>As you approach, it is just before sunset. Someone in town must have spotted you. A boy approaches and when he reaches you introduces himself as Kaya. He says he’s here to take you to the elders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters ask Kaya about the Station, he tells them that he thinks it’d be better if the elders talk to him first. He doesn’t know much about what is happening, other than that hunting has been banned north of the cliff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaya brings you to a large home just off the center of town. In the home, two women stand over a table, blueprints and maps laid out in front of them. A third sits at a small table absorbed in a VR session.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The women are Horit, Ochanton, and Taaki. They are the leaders of the town and live here together. When the Characters enter, Horit holds her hand up, as Ochanton finishes discussing a plan for a new silo. They turn their attention to the Characters then and Horit taps Taaki on the shoulder, prompting her to remove the VR headset.</p>\n<p>Ochanton, the oldest of the three, speaks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’ve been expecting you. You should know that the Counsel doesn’t hold much sway here. The crew of the Station were good people though, so we’ll help if we can.” She takes a seat and then the other two do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are enough chairs for everyone to sit, but the elders don’t seem to care either way. When asked about the Station, they don’t know much but answer freely. The three scientists haven’t been seen for several weeks. They used to regularly come into town for supplies and to enjoy some company.</p>\n<p>If asked about the last time they saw the scientists, or if the Players seem to be struggling to find questions, Horit will volunteer her last recollection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The last time we saw them Liwanu enjoyed some tea with me. I was telling her that we weren’t going to be doing any more hunting to the north for….” Ochanton stops her sort with a glance. Horit glares “Well it’s said now.” She resumes “We’ve stopped hunting to the north, above the cliffs, because many of the villagers have had bad dreams about that area. There is an evil there even if some don’t take it seriously.” Ochanton rolls her eyes at that, clearly part of the ‘some.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When asked about the bad dreams only Hurin answers, and she describes dreams of a shadowy figure that consumes women.</p>\n<p>When the questioning has concluded, Taaki speaks up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You shouldn’t go out in the cold and dark, the terrain is dangerous even for our people.We’ve asked Kaya’s mother to give you a bed for the night. He’ll take you home and see that you are fed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kaya brings them to a house near the edge of the village. On the walk he’ll excitedly ask the characters about their training and adventures. He hasn’t yet had his Adanadi and is hoping he receives an Ability. If the subject of his parents comes up though, he quiets down and hurries them home.</p>\n<p>Kaya’s mother Chipi is expecting them when they arrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaya opens the door to the longhouse and you smell a deer and root vegetable stew kept warm on a stovetop. Chipi, Kaya’s mother, turns and nods, replacing the ladle into the stew and wiping her hands on her apron. “The elders told me to expect you. I wasn’t sure if you’d have eaten so I kept it warm.” She indicates a long bench near the door. “You can keep your bags and such there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"modules/cnc-core/images/station%2054/54-3.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"617\" /></p>\n<p>If the Characters look around the house they will notice a small memorial near the door, and the larder near empty. Chipi’s husband died recently of a heart attack and they are still in mourning. A Character familiar with cooking or who is particularly observant will note that the stew she prepared is a large percentage of what they had available. If pressed, Chipi will admit that the family has fallen on hard times since he passed, but the community is caring for them.</p>\n<p>Choose a Skill from one of the Characters that has not been used yet, ideally from the Player who has had the least opportunity to be in the lead. Photos and books around the longhouse indicate that Chipi’s husband worked in that field. A scientific researcher, a farmer, a craftsman, or the like. Give the Player an opportunity to engage with Kaya about it — this will lift Kaya’s and Chipi’s spirits.</p>\n<p>Chipi will lay out hunting and climbing gear for the team the next morning as a thank you for cheering them up in this way.</p>\n<p>When the evening is done, the Characters are shown to a room with some mattresses laid out for their beds.

The Station is nestled in a steep valley that looks like a rocky wound in the earth. Narrow and jagged, the crevice is about 500 feet wide at its widest point and 100 feet deep. There are two structures; one a prefabricated living quarters, and the other a mechanical device that you’ll have to examine more closely to identify.</p></blockquote><p>If the Characters did not stop the team that Siik mentioned, read the Characters this:</p><blockquote><p>Walking around the structures, you can see four individuals dressed in highly specialized uniforms that aren’t familiar to you. They approach the living quarters cautiously and after checking the windows, they relax. Two go inside. The door apparently is already open, while one examines the other structure and one keeps watch.</p></blockquote><p>If the Characters do nothing and continue to observe, the team remains there for about an hour and then leaves. If they see the Characters or are engaged, they will attempt to flee. If they are captured or killed, the Players can learn with 3+ Successes from a Coercion or Hacking Check that they found that the Station was conducting geological surveying in violation of treaties. They will also find the reports from the digging machine described later.

Characters can look for clues using Investigation, can search the workstations with a Computer Check, or can attempt to use Hacking to access the machine controls. Any Character with Science (Geology) will automatically identify the mechanical structure as a core drilling rig. Characters with Farming will automatically know that this station’s value for gathering weather data is limited.</p><img style=\"float:right\" src=\"modules/cnc-core/images/station%2054/54-4.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"355\" /><p>If the Ti’Swaq team wasn’t interrupted while they investigated the building, they were ahead of the Characters, or the Characters chose not to interfere, the Computer checks have a Success Number of 7, as the Characters can see recent access logs and see where the team was looking.</p><p>In digging too far, the scientists disturbed a monster from legend, Niniyan. He manipulated their dreams, causing Yanaba, the only woman assigned there, to flee and the other two scientists to look for her. Niniyan climbed out and then killed and consumed the two men. Yanaba succumbed to the elements before reaching town.</p><p>There are many ways that your Players might want to approach the next step, and all of them can’t be anticipated. Here is how to handle the three most likely roads they’ll take. If the Characters take no action before sleeping for the night, they have bad dreams as indicated below and are attacked in the morning by Niniyan. The Characters will be Surprised.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.o63rOA1toENA1Gjf]{Niniyan / Stone Man}</p><h3>Path 1</h3><p>Force a confrontation with Niniyan, either by climbing down the hole into the tunnels below or setting up an ambush outside it. In the latter case, they will wait at least a day. Any Characters who are women will have dreams of a monster coming for them and the feeling that they should flee. All other Characters will dream that they should climb down the hole and attack rather than waiting.

This requires a Skill Check Over Time, needing 9 Successes with Science (Geology), Success Number 10 or 8 Successes with Computers, Success Number 9 will effectively close it off. Otherwise, sufficient explosives can be made from the fuel and batteries running the Station to blow it shut, requiring 4 Successes with Crafting, Success Number 9.</p><h3>Path 3</h3><p>Allow Niniyan to remain free. Characters may either choose to return home, having determined the fate of the Station, their mission completed. They can also return to Sakitawaak to warn them of the danger. Either way, more people will die and the Station will not be recovered.
