{"_id":"4hlPHTy4arjy9F1s","name":"Part 3 - Encounter at Station 54","content":"<h2>Part 3</h2>\n<p>Sakitawaak is two days' travel north of Antiwaa. When the Characters decide to continue that way, they can get additional supplies from Siik before they go. The travel is uneventful. Further north the air gets colder and the land more barren, the signal on their niisi fade and is completely gone by the time they reach the village, meaning they can only communicate as far as the horizon now. As they approach Sakitawaak, read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The village ahead is laid out in a series of concentric rings, set in an open, flat area with an imposing cliff wall to the north, running east to west. The solar and wind generators seem to be kept in good repair, and robot harvesters are working fields to the east. You don’t see any yutsu barges or sunwings, but that’s not unusual for communities this far from large scale printing facilities.</p>\n<p>As you approach, it is just before sunset. Someone in town must have spotted you. A boy approaches and when he reaches you introduces himself as Kaya. He says he’s here to take you to the elders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters ask Kaya about the Station, he tells them that he thinks it’d be better if the elders talk to him first. He doesn’t know much about what is happening, other than that hunting has been banned north of the cliff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaya brings you to a large home just off the center of town. In the home, two women stand over a table, blueprints and maps laid out in front of them. A third sits at a small table absorbed in a VR session.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The women are Horit, Ochanton, and Taaki. They are the leaders of the town and live here together. When the Characters enter, Horit holds her hand up, as Ochanton finishes discussing a plan for a new silo. They turn their attention to the Characters then and Horit taps Taaki on the shoulder, prompting her to remove the VR headset.</p>\n<p>Ochanton, the oldest of the three, speaks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We’ve been expecting you. You should know that the Counsel doesn’t hold much sway here. The crew of the Station were good people though, so we’ll help if we can.” She takes a seat and then the other two do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are enough chairs for everyone to sit, but the elders don’t seem to care either way. When asked about the Station, they don’t know much but answer freely. The three scientists haven’t been seen for several weeks. They used to regularly come into town for supplies and to enjoy some company.</p>\n<p>If asked about the last time they saw the scientists, or if the Players seem to be struggling to find questions, Horit will volunteer her last recollection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The last time we saw them Liwanu enjoyed some tea with me. I was telling her that we weren’t going to be doing any more hunting to the north for….” Ochanton stops her sort with a glance. Horit glares “Well it’s said now.” She resumes “We’ve stopped hunting to the north, above the cliffs, because many of the villagers have had bad dreams about that area. There is an evil there even if some don’t take it seriously.” Ochanton rolls her eyes at that, clearly part of the ‘some.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When asked about the bad dreams only Hurin answers, and she describes dreams of a shadowy figure that consumes women.</p>\n<p>When the questioning has concluded, Taaki speaks up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You shouldn’t go out in the cold and dark, the terrain is dangerous even for our people.We’ve asked Kaya’s mother to give you a bed for the night. He’ll take you home and see that you are fed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kaya brings them to a house near the edge of the village. On the walk he’ll excitedly ask the characters about their training and adventures. He hasn’t yet had his Adanadi and is hoping he receives an Ability. If the subject of his parents comes up though, he quiets down and hurries them home.</p>\n<p>Kaya’s mother Chipi is expecting them when they arrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kaya opens the door to the longhouse and you smell a deer and root vegetable stew kept warm on a stovetop. Chipi, Kaya’s mother, turns and nods, replacing the ladle into the stew and wiping her hands on her apron. “The elders told me to expect you. I wasn’t sure if you’d have eaten so I kept it warm.” She indicates a long bench near the door. “You can keep your bags and such there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"modules/cnc-core/images/station%2054/54-3.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"617\" /></p>\n<p>If the Characters look around the house they will notice a small memorial near the door, and the larder near empty. Chipi’s husband died recently of a heart attack and they are still in mourning. A Character familiar with cooking or who is particularly observant will note that the stew she prepared is a large percentage of what they had available. If pressed, Chipi will admit that the family has fallen on hard times since he passed, but the community is caring for them.</p>\n<p>Choose a Skill from one of the Characters that has not been used yet, ideally from the Player who has had the least opportunity to be in the lead. Photos and books around the longhouse indicate that Chipi’s husband worked in that field. A scientific researcher, a farmer, a craftsman, or the like. Give the Player an opportunity to engage with Kaya about it — this will lift Kaya’s and Chipi’s spirits.</p>\n<p>Chipi will lay out hunting and climbing gear for the team the next morning as a thank you for cheering them up in this way.</p>\n<p>When the evening is done, the Characters are shown to a room with some mattresses laid out for their beds. The next morning Chipi is out and Kaya offers them some warm porridge for breakfast before leaving to go to his lessons.</p>\n<p>The Characters can pick up supplies in town and question the locals if they wish. If they ask around, they will learn that only women have been having the dreams and that they started just before the scientist’s last visit, three weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Characters who wish to make a Folklore check to get a sense of what’s happening may do so. The DC is 9 unless they have determined that only women receive the dreams, in which case it is 8.</p>\n<table style=\"height:64px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">There are legends about Niniyan, the Stone Man, a legend from the region</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">It's said that Niniyan can be trapped with a stone tomb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Niniyani is almost impossible to kill, except with the blood of a woman.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"TqWmlBE7xX00vhjb":3},"flags":{"coyote-and-crow":{"initialization-folder":"Encounter at Station 54","sort":400000}}}

Yours is better appointed than most, having two levels with several fire pits for passengers to sit around. The other passengers are mostly traveling to visit family or business partners. At the end of the line you are the only remaining passengers. As you leave, a few people get on for the trip back to Cahokia. You step out onto a bluff with roads heading off in each direction. A small structure there protects from the wind and a map shows the surrounding communities. Near the mound is a communications tower helping to extend daso to the limits of the Free Lands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Antiwaa is another two days to the north on foot. On the road are regularly-spaced lock boxes that contain food and water for unprepared travelers. If any of your Characters have Survival, allow them to describe how they provide food for the group, otherwise allow them to use the boxes or simply say that they packed preserved foods for the trip. Detail their travel only so long as it’s interesting then immediately cut to them approaching Antiwaa.</p>\n<p>As the sun begins to go down, you see the town ahead, a couple dozen structures surrounded by farms carved out of hard soil. As a Suyata, your first responsibility is to present yourself to the local leaders. Suyata teams are few and are expected to offer their services, so long as it does not conflict with the Council’s orders.</p>\n<p>If the Characters seek out the town’s leaders, they find the home of Siik who invites them to join his family for dinner. After a pleasant meal and conversation, he shoos his family away so he can speak with the Characters privately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I didn’t want to worry my children. I’m glad that you’re here and I hope you can look into something for us. Recently I’ve been receiving reports of a small group traveling north. Ordinarily this wouldn’t be a concern, but they move like a military unit, but they aren’t from the Free Lands.” He takes a datapad from a shelf and pulls up a blurry image of four people moving single file up a hill. “They evaded a group of volunteers who went out to look for them and seemed to be heading north. I don’t want to be the man who ignores the signs of a possible invasion. I was going to send a request for a Suyata team tomorrow morning, but then you arrived.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the Characters question Siik further, he only knows that they were first sighted a day before and that they have been covering their tracks well — it was only luck that their passage was discovered at all.</p>\n<p>If the Characters investigate the image or the tracks and signs discovered by the town, they can make a Knowledge or Tracking Check respectively to try to identify the figures.</p>\n<p>There are many ways that your Players might want to tackle this problem, and all of them can’t be anticipated. Here is how to handle the three mostly likely roads they’ll take.</p>\n<table style=\"height:64px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Knowledge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">The team looks military by the gear.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">Two of them are specialists with little field training</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Their formation is something you've seen in Ti'Swaq recon units</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"height:64px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">The group is only the four people in the photo.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">The tracks are partially covered, at least one has counter-intelligence training.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">If they keep their course, they're going to Station 54.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"modules/cnc-core/images/station%2054/54-1.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"548\" /></p>\n<h3>Path A</h3>\n<p>Attack the mysterious team, attempting to capture or destroy them.</p>\n<p>With at least 3 Successes on a Tracking or Athletics check, the Characters can catch up with the team about half a day’s travel north. The team’s stats are listed at the end of this adventure. When they fight, Wayata and Kathak will engage until Tahatan and Dakotah can get away, then they will begin to retreat trying to hold the team off. If one of the Ti’Swaq is downed, one of the others will try to pull them to cover. If they can’t be revived, anything indicating their mission will be removed and the others will flee.</p>\n<p>If the Ti’Swaq team is killed, the Characters can search them, finding the gear listed in their description, as well as an encrypted message on Wayata’s niisi. 3 Successes on a Hacking check will reveal a map with Station 54 marked. A Critical Success will decrypt the whole message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OBJECTIVE: Collect data on Station. Official reports indicate a weather station, but intelligence suggests investigations in violation of treaties. Do not engage unless necessary, report back with findings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Path B</h3>\n<p>Track the team to determine their intent.</p>\n<p>With at least 3 Successes on a Tracking roll, the Characters can find and follow the trail left by the Ti’Swaq unit. To remain unseen they must succeed against Wayata in a Stealth check. Following the team, they are led up the ridge and toward Station 54. If the Characters remain undetected, skip to Part 4. If they are detected, see Path C, below.</p>\n<h3>Path C</h3>\n<p>Attempt to speak with or directly approach the team.</p>\n<p>If the Players choose to openly approach the team — or are caught after attempting Path B, the team will attempt to flee. They will not engage with, negotiate with, or parley with the Players under any circumstances. If cornered or otherwise unable to flee they will do everything they can to disengage peacefully, but if they feel physically threatened, they will defend themselves. Once they are convinced they have evaded the Players for at least one day, they’ll return to their mission.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"TqWmlBE7xX00vhjb":3},"flags":{"coyote-and-crow":{"initialization-folder":"Encounter at Station 54","sort":300000}}}

If they see the Characters or are engaged, they will attempt to flee. If they are captured or killed, the Players can learn with 3+ Successes from a Coercion or Hacking Check that they found that the Station was conducting geological surveying in violation of treaties.

The Characters will be Surprised.</p>\n<h3>Path 1</h3>\n<p>Force a confrontation with Niniyan, either by climbing down the hole into the tunnels below or setting up an ambush outside it. In the latter case, they will wait at least a day. Any Characters who are women will have dreams of a monster coming for them and the feeling that they should flee. All other Characters will dream that they should climb down the hole and attack rather than waiting. On the second day, Niniyan will emerge — Its details can be found in the Icons and Legends chapter.</p>\n<table style=\"height:64px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Investigation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">There’s some blood spatter from a club or rock just outside the door.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:13px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:13px\">There was no struggle in the residence, no one was forced out.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">There are signs of a fight just behind the machine.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"height:64px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:17px\">Computer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">There are personal journals.

Characters may either choose to return home, having determined the fate of the Station, their mission completed. They can also return to Sakitawaak to warn them of the danger. Either way, more people will die and the Station will not be recovered.

{"_id":"VPWq9OQYbvKEmwtO","name":"Part 1 - Encounter at Station 54","content":"<h2>Part 1</h2>\n<p>Once everyone is ready to start and has a Character, read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's twilight and the forest around you is eerily silent, only the crunch of the leaves under your feed cutting through. Suddenly, you're nearly blinded by a bright light, a spotlight mounted to a modified drone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have each of the Players choose their Initiative Score. Three raiders, each armed withWar Axes, and three drones armed with Mag-Slings and spotlights ambush the characters. No one is Surprised in this Encounter.</p>\n<p>Raiders (3)</p>\n<p>@Actor[Raiders]</p>\n<p>The Raiders act on Initiative Score 2, 4, and 6. They target the last Character that attacked them, or whoever is closest.</p>\n<p>Drones (3)</p>\n<p>@Actor[Drones]</p>\n<p>The Drones all act on Initiative Score 8 and choose their targets at random.</p>\n<p>At the end of the second round:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The enemies in front of you freeze and briefly blur when a box of text appears in the center of your field of vision. “SIMULATION ENDED: Priority Message Incoming”</p>\n<p>The forest and drones fade away and the message is automatically played. A young woman’s voice speaks. “Good Morning Kolisoo, apologies for interrupting your training. The Council of Twelve has sent a summons. Report to the Council Hall immediately.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When they remove their Second Eye Headsets, they are in a large dirt circle marked by stones. Their gear sits off to one side and the path to Cahokia leads West. Any Damage received during the simulation is immediately healed.</p>\n<p>Cahokia is a bustling, open city that sprawls for miles. Brightly painted low buildings constructed on earthen mounds contrast against 100-foot-tall spires. Yutsu barges float effortlessly just above the rooftops while smaller sunwings zip around the sky. People go about their shopping and children play with their grandparents under an almost cloudless sky.</p>\n<p>While the world opens up and gets more hospitable, treaties are fraying, and the unexplored north inspires excitement in some and fear in others. The Characters remind people that the world is changing, and they may react with discomfort.</p>\n<p>The Council’s receiving chamber is accessed at the top of a series of short broad steps. The walls are painted in patterns that draw your eye to the broad, curved table where the Council sits. These are the representatives of the most powerful tribes and families in Cahokia and are accustomed to deference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arenia, a grey-haired Councilor with taut dark skin and piercing eyes, addresses you.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for coming promptly. I understand that this is your first mission; congratulations on joining the ranks of the Suyata. Your service is appreciated. There may be a problem at one of our northern Stations and we are sending your team to investigate. Not a glamorous first assignment, but prove yourselves and more opportunities will come.</p>\n<p>Station 54, an atmospheric research station, has stopped sending communications. The nearest community, Sakitawaak, reports that the scientists stationed there have not been seen in three weeks. The mission details have been sent to your niisi, submit your reports when the mission is complete. Prosperous Journey.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Characters are ushered out as another group, likely a political delegation, enters. Their niisi display a priority message including their mission briefing. They are to travel to Station 54 and determine why communication has stopped, investigating if it seems a crime has been committed. They’ve been authorized to use force as necessary. They are advised to proceed cautiously if investigating in Sakitawak, as it is an independent community and not subject to the Council. Also included is a map of the area and a brief datasheet on the three scientists stationed there.</p>\n<p>If the Characters research the village or station, they can use their niisi with a Computer Check, or research at the library and make Knowledge or Science check as appropriate. If the Players consider Hacking the government systems, it’s a good time to remind them that they work for the government, and understand going in that information was “need to know.”</p>\n<p>They have about two hours before the next yutsu barge heading north leaves, giving them the opportunity to interact with their families or do some shopping before they go. They will have to take the barge to the north terminal, then travel by foot to Antiwaa. From there, they will continue to Sakitawaak a village a few miles from Station 54.</p>\n<table style=\"height:78px;width:85.6734%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"color:#ffffff;height:10px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:10px\">Successes</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#3c1f60;text-align:left;height:10px\">Computer Search: Sakitawaak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">1+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#e5f0f8;height:17px\">Population 70, Chief Export: Lead.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:34px\">\n<td style=\"width:14.0905%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:34px\">3+</td>\n<td style=\"width:85.9095%;background-color:#ebe8ef;height:34px\">Town is outside daso range.
